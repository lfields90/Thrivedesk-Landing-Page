# ThriveDesk Landing Page - Frontend Development Practice

![Design preview for the ThriveDesk Landing Page coding challenge](/designs/Thrivedesk-Final-svgs.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**Hi, my name is LaMonte and thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.**

To do this challenge, I needed a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and Responsive Design.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this the ThriveDesk landing page and get it looking as close to the provided PNG as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the landing page on mobile, tablet, laptop, and desktop while receiving similar experiences
- See the `Thrivedesk Info` section display overlapping card images utilizing css positioning
- See the `Features`, `Reporting`, and `Knowledge Base` sections transform from a column layout to a row layout using `Flexbox`

## Where to find everything

All of the required design assets are located in ... you guessed it, ... the `/design` folder.

The design prompt is in PNG static format. This means that I needed to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

## Got feedback for me?

I love receiving feedback! I'm always looking to improve my coding skills, so if you have anything you'd like to mention, please email lamonte.fields[at]gmail[dot]com.
